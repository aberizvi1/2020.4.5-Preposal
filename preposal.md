# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

-I want to take in 3 inputs (name, state of origin, and email address).
-Using a dataset of donors from online I want to cross reference it with that list.
-My goal is to identify how many times each input is found in the dataset and provide
a summary of what I can determine about the user based on their inputs.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I do not plan to collaborate with classmates.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is there a code length goal?
Considering the scope of the project is pretty broad, how much bigger do I need to be
thinking about this project, and is there a number of desired specific types of code
(i.e. for loops, defined functions, inputs, turtle visuals, etc)?
